# Memory Game Project

This game was built as a [Udacity](www.udacity.com) Front End Nano Degree project. The purpose is to demostrate mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also implemented jQuery in this project.

## Udacity Project Instructions

This project included starter files with some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. In order to complete this project, it was necessary to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
More specific, detailed instructions, were made avaible by Udacity in the project instructions located within the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How To Play:

1. Match cards with identical faces.
2. You are able to keep track of your game progress in the score panel area. 
3. You are given a star rating starting with 3 stars. These stars decrease as your moves increase. 
4. The score panel also tracks how many moves you make. 
5. A timer tells you how long it takes you to finish the game.
6. You can restart the game at any time by clicking on the restart button in the score pannel.
7. Upon matching all cards you will get a congratulatory pop up modal informing you of your score stats for the game.
